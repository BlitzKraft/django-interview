=== Rooster thumbnail overload! ===


Problem description
--------------------------

    Eek!  There's a *bazillion* thumbnail images on Rooster and it's getting out of hand!

    We know users upload all sorts of pictures of stuff they have to give away.
    And they upload pics of their friendly faces too.

    But after a series of visual redesigns over the years... us Rooster programmer
    folk no longer have a good sense of what thumbnail sizes we're using!
    That's not good.


What to do:
----------

    Write a program which displays a report of thumbnail sizes on Rooster.

    Why?  ...so we can bring it to our design team to decide what *really* are the thumbnail sizes we should use on the website!

    You can use as input the following file:  http://paloalto.therooster.co/static/fun-rooster-thumbnail-names.txt

    What this file contains is the absolute URL of a sample of thumbnail images on Rooster on every line.
    (you might notice there is a consistent pattern to them!).

    Python honestly would be preferable.  But not at all a requirement!

    And just for clarity, as sample output, the report might indicate something like "700x250 thumbnail occurs 25 times" (and so on)


Other random "extra credit" things:
-----------------------------------

    If bored, you might make a Django app (because we use Django!)
    which has a text file upload input, and outputs the report on a webpage!

    You might even spice up a report like this in the view with HTML/CSS/JS/template stuff.
    And/or basically whatever you want/random stuff etc. etc.
    Maybe you can sort by count?  Maybe you can filter by width or height?  A command line option for that would work for that too probably!
    Maybe even a model to save a report?

    Maybe find where a particular thumbnail is used on Rooster, if it's even still being used!  (hint: 'View Source' or 'Inspect element')

    Or really anything you think might be fun :D   (doesn't need to make sense <3)
